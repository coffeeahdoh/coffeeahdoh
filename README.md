Hi all! I'm Mikey, a Data Analyst.

Currently, my favorite language is R, but am also leveling up in Python and SQL. My heart is in biology (MSc Microbiology), but my purpose is in healthcare. Increasing patient access to medications and patient outcomes is the ultimate goal. 

My repo's are forever works in progress and more of my personal journey than anything else at the moment. The mistakes I make are sometimes laughable ... but always pushing my progress to greater ends!
